1. **Copy the Content**:
   - The content of the `README.md` file is provided within the ````` tag in the response. You can manually copy the text 
   (excluding the ````` tags and attributes) into a text editor.

2. **Save as a File**:
   - Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code, or any IDE).
   - Paste the copied content.
   - Save the file with the name `README.md` in your project directory (e.g., `ticket-booking-system/`).

3. **Example of Copied Content**:
   Ensure you only copy the markdown content starting from `# Simple Ticket Booking System` to the end of the license section, like this:

   ```markdown
   # Simple Ticket Booking System

   This project is a simple ticket booking system developed as part of a PHP Developer Interview Assignment. It allows users to register, log in, browse events, book tickets using AJAX, and view their booking history. The system is built using Core PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, with security measures like prepared statements, input sanitization, and session-based authentication.

   ## Features
   ...
   ```

4. **Alternative: Manual Download**:
   - If you prefer a direct download, you can create a file manually by copying the content into a text editor and saving it as `README.md`. Unfortunately, there’s no direct "download" button for the artifact in this interface, so manual copying is required.

5. **Add to GitHub Repository**:
   - If you’re using a GitHub repository (as mentioned in the assignment), place the `README.md` file in the root of your project folder.
   - Commit and push the file to your repository:
     ```bash
     git add README.md
     git commit -m "Add README.md"
     git push origin main
     ```

6. **Verify**:
   - Ensure the file is saved with the `.md` extension to render correctly on GitHub or other markdown viewers.
   - Check your project directory to confirm `README.md` exists.

If you need the `README.md` file to be generated again or have issues with copying, let me know, and I can assist further! Alternatively, if you meant downloading the entire project (including the `README.md`), you’d need to implement the project files as per the assignment and follow the repository setup instructions in the `README.md`.

# Simple Ticket Booking System

This project is a simple ticket booking system developed as part of a PHP Developer Interview Assignment. It allows users to register, log in, browse events, book tickets using AJAX, and view their booking history. The system is built using Core PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, with security measures like prepared statements, input sanitization, and session-based authentication.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**
   - User registration and login using PHP sessions.
   - Secure password storage with password hashing.
   - Non-logged-in users are redirected to the login page.

2. **Event Listing**
   - Displays 3-5 pre-defined events fetched from the MySQL database.
   - Each event includes name, date, venue, and available seats.
   - Users can click "Book Ticket" to book an event.

3. **Ticket Booking**
   - Booking is processed via AJAX to prevent page reload.
   - Updates available seats and stores booking details (user ID, event ID, timestamp) in the database.
   - Displays a success message upon booking.

4. **Booking History**
   - Users can view their past bookings with event details and booking time.
   - Pagination is implemented for handling multiple bookings.

5. **Security**
   - Uses PDO with prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
   - Input sanitization and validation to prevent XSS.
   - Session-based authentication for secure access.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Core PHP
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript (AJAX for booking)
- **Database**: MySQL

## Prerequisites

- PHP 7.4 or higher
- MySQL 5.7 or higher
- Apache or Nginx web server
- Composer (optional, if dependencies are added)
- Git

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ticket-booking-system.git
   cd ticket-booking-system
   ```

2. **Set Up the Database**
   - Create a MySQL database (e.g., `ticket_db`).
   - Import the `database.sql` file located in the `database/` folder to set up the schema and sample data.
   ```bash
   mysql -u your_username -p ticket_booking < database/database.sql
   ```

3. **Configure Database Connection**
   - Open `config/db.php` and update the database credentials:
     ```php
     define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
     define('DB_USER', 'your_username');
     define('DB_PASS', 'your_password');
     define('DB_NAME', 'ticket_db');
     ```

4. **Set Up the Web Server**
   - Place the project folder in your web server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for Apache).
   - Ensure the web server has write permissions for session handling.

5. **Access the Application**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/ticket-booking-system`.
   - Register a new user or log in to explore the system.

## Notes

- Ensure the database is properly set up before running the application.
- The AJAX booking feature requires JavaScript to be enabled in the browser.
- Pagination on the booking history page is set to display 5 bookings per page (configurable in the code).
- Sample events are included in the `database.sql` file for testing.
